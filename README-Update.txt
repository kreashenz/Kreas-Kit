This is a read me, make sure you read or else you might break the config!

I have added in horses and they are very configurable. There is many different
types of horses, like undeads, normal, mules, skeletons. I also added the
ability to set the player force riding the horse, and to spawn and edit
the colours.

Here's all the available horse colours:
white, creamy, chestnut, brown, black, gray, dark_brown, invisible.

Here's all the available horse types and ids:

Horse | id

normal    | 0
donkey    | 1
mule      | 2
undead    | 3
skeletal  | 4
invisible | 6
